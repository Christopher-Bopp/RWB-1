Extra Credits
1.Security
Implemented user,password and Cookie encrytion using xor encryption. Encryption is done in javascript and decryption is done in perl. But due to database overload error couldn't integrate with main project and test. So we have enclosed the encryption/decryption code.

2.Deeper Analysis Queries
 Proposed additional queries for monetary side of electioneering but not implemented.(Extra-credit-Queries.txt)


Assumptions and Comments
In case of aggregated view, for committees, we tried the following query initially and since it took longer we changed the query by breaking it into smaller queries but still it was not faster
The initial query was 
eval { 
    @rows = ExecSQL($dbuser, $dbpasswd, 
"select sum(sum_amt) from (select sum(transaction_amnt) as sum_amt, cmte_pty_affiliation from cs339.committee_master natural join cs339.cmte_id_to_geo natural join cs339.comm_to_comm where cycle in (".join(',',@cyc).") and latitude>? and latitude<? and longitude>? and longitude<? and cmte_pty_affiliation in ('DEM','REP') group by cmte_pty_affiliation
 union all
 select sum(transaction_amnt) as sum_amt, cmte_pty_affiliation from cs339.committee_master natural join cs339.cmte_id_to_geo natural join cs339.comm_to_cand where cycle in (".join(',',@cyc).") and latitude>? and latitude<? and longitude>? and longitude<? and cmte_pty_affiliation in ('DEM','REP') group by cmte_pty_affiliation"
,undef,$latsw,$latne,$longsw,$longne,$latsw,$latne,$longsw,$longne));
